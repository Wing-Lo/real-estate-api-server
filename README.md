### R2. Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.

In managing my project, I chose to use Trello as my main tool for task allocation and tracking. I organised my project tasks into three lists: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" within Trello to visually manage the status of each task. This approach allows me to prioritise and focus on completing tasks efficiently.

Each task in Trello includes a due date, which helps me stay disciplined and ensures I keep on track with my project timeline. This setup is crucial for maintaining a sense of progress and meeting project milestones.

For tasks that require detailed implementation, such as creating the database, models, and blueprints for entities like users, agents, testimonials, and bookings, I utilised Trello's checklist feature. This allows me to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. I also used the checklist feature to handle all endpoints testing. Checking off items on the checklist ensures that I cover all necessary aspects of each task before marking it as complete.

Regular stand-up posts have been part of my routine to review progress, adjust priorities, and reflect on any challenges encountered. This practice helps me maintain focus and adapt to any changes or new insights that arise during the project.

Overall, Trello has been an effective tool for me to organise, track, and manage my project tasks independently, ensuring I stay productive and meet my project goals effectively.

   - **Example**: For example, the `languages` column in the `Agent` model can be stored as an array, allowing easy storage and retrieval of multiple languages an agent speaks.
     ```python
     class Agent(db.Model):
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
         email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
         contact_number = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
         overview = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
         languages = db.Column(db.ARRAY(db.String), nullable=False)
     ```

3. **Strong Community and Ecosystem**
   - **Benefit**: PostgreSQL has a strong, active community and a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions, making it easier to find support, resources, and integrations for various needs.
   - **Example**: Leveraging tools like pgAdmin for database management or using extensions like PostGIS for geospatial data enhances the capabilities of the application without needing significant custom development.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Benefit**: PostgreSQL offers various performance optimization features, such as indexing, query optimization, and the ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
   - **Example**: In my application, indexing frequently queried columns (like `email` in the `User` model) helps improve query performance.
     ```python
     class User(db.Model):
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
         email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False, index=True)
         contact_number = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
         password = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
         is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
     ```

#### Drawbacks

1. **Complexity in Setup and Maintenance**
   - **Drawback**: PostgreSQL can be more complex to set up and maintain compared to some other databases. It requires proper configuration and tuning to achieve optimal performance.

### R5. Explain the features, purpose and functionalities of the object-relational mapping system (ORM) used in this app.

In this project, I heavily leverage SQLAlchemy, a powerful and flexible ORM system, to handle the interaction between the application and the relational database. SQLAlchemy allows me to map Python classes to database tables and manage database operations using Python code, which simplifies database interactions and enhances code readability and maintainability.

#### Key Features, Purpose, and Functionalities of SQLAlchemy in This App

1. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**
   - SQLAlchemy's core feature is its ORM capability, which allows me to map Python classes to database tables. This mapping enables me to interact with the database using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from init import db

     class User(db.Model):
         __tablename__ = 'users'
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
         email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
         contact_number = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
         password = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
         is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

     class Testimonial(db.Model):
         __tablename__ = 'testimonials'
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         property_address = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
         comment = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
         rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
         date_created = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=False)
         user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
         agent_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('agents.id'), nullable=False)
     ```

2. **Data Sanitization**
   - By utilizing SQLAlchemy, I ensure that data is automatically sanitized, which helps prevent SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. SQLAlchemy takes care of escaping special characters and handling parameters correctly, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the database.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @users_bp.route("/<int:user_id>", methods=["PUT", "PATCH"])
     @jwt_required()
     def update_user(user_id):
         user = User.query.get(user_id)

         if user:
             admin_or_owner_required(user_id)
             user_info = UserSchema().load(request.json, partial=True)
             user.name = user_info.get("name", user.name)
             user.email = user_info.get("email", user.email)
             user.password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(
                 user_info.get("password", user.password)
             ).decode("utf-8")
             user.contact_number = user_info.get("contact_number", user.contact_number)

             db.session.commit()

             return UserSchema(exclude=["password"]).dump(user)
         else:
             return {"error": "User not found"}, 404
     ```

3. **Relationships and Associations**
   - SQLAlchemy enables me to define relationships between different tables, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This helps in organizing data efficiently and enables complex queries and data retrieval.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class User(db.Model):
         __tablename__ = 'users'
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
         email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
         testimonials = db.relationship('Testimonial', backref='user', lazy=True)

     class Testimonial(db.Model):
         __tablename__ = 'testimonials'
         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
         property_address = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
         comment = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
         rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
         date_created = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=False)
         user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
         agent_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('agents.id'), nullable=False)
     ```

4. **Querying**
   - SQLAlchemy's ORM allows me to write complex queries using Python syntax. This makes the code more intuitive and easier to understand compared to raw SQL queries.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @testimonials_bp.route("/", methods=["GET"])
     @jwt_required()
     def get_all_testimonials():
         stmt = db.select(Testimonial).order_by(Testimonial.id)
         testimonials = db.session.scalars(stmt).all()
         return TestimonialSchema(many=True, exclude=["agent_id", "user_id"]).dump(testimonials)
     ```

5. **Serialization and Deserialization**
   - By using Marshmallow along with SQLAlchemy, I can easily serialize and deserialize data, converting complex data types to and from native Python data types.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from models.testimonial import TestimonialSchema

     @testimonials_bp.route("/<int:testimonial_id>", methods=["GET"])
     @jwt_required()
     def get_one_testimonial(testimonial_id):
         stmt = db.select(Testimonial).filter_by(id=testimonial_id)
         testimonial = db.session.scalar(stmt)
         if testimonial:
             return TestimonialSchema(exclude=["agent_id", "user_id"]).dump(testimonial)
         else:
             return {"error": "Testimonial not found"}, 404
     ```

### Conclusion

SQLAlchemy is a critical component of my application, providing robust ORM capabilities that streamline database interactions, ensure data integrity, and enhance security through data sanitization. By leveraging SQLAlchemy's features, I can maintain clean and efficient code, manage database migrations, and define complex relationships between data models, ultimately resulting in a well-structured and secure application.

  - **Attributes**: `id`, `property_address`, `comment`, `rating`, `date_created`, `user_id`, `agent_id`
  - **Role**: Captures user feedback about agents. It stores and organises testimonials, making it easier to analyse user satisfaction and agent performance.

### Users and Appointments Relationship:

- **One-to-Many**: A single user can schedule multiple appointments.
- **Design Benefit**: This allows the system to keep track of all appointments made by each user. By linking appointments to users with the `user_id` foreign key in the Appointments table, it becomes easy to query the database to see which appointments belong to a particular user. This helps in personalising user experiences and managing user schedules efficiently.

### Agents and Appointments Relationship:

- **One-to-Many**: A single agent can handle multiple appointments.
- **Design Benefit**: This relationship enables effective management of each agent's schedule. By linking appointments to agents using the `agent_id` foreign key, it is possible to see which appointments are assigned to which agents. This ensures that agents are not double-booked and helps in managing their time efficiently.

### Users and Testimonials Relationship:

- **One-to-Many**: A single user can write multiple testimonials.
- **Design Benefit**: This helps in tracking all feedback provided by users. By associating testimonials with users through the `user_id` foreign key, all testimonials a user has written can be gathered. This is useful for analysing user satisfaction and identifying loyal customers who provide feedback regularly.

### Agents and Testimonials Relationship:

- **One-to-Many**: A single agent can receive multiple testimonials.
- **Design Benefit**: This relationship enables the collection of all feedback an agent receives. By linking testimonials to agents using the `agent_id` foreign key, it is possible to see how many and what type of feedback each agent gets. This helps in evaluating agent performance and identifying top-performing agents based on user feedback.

### Benefits of These Relationships:

1. **Data Integrity**:
   - **Ensured Consistency**: Foreign keys ensure that appointments and testimonials are always linked to valid users and agents, preventing data inconsistencies.
   - **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys prevent orphan records, ensuring that every appointment and testimonial is associated with an existing user and agent.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - **Efficient Queries**: The relationships make it easy to retrieve relevant data. For instance, it is straightforward to find all appointments for a user or all testimonials for an agent, enhancing the app's responsiveness and user experience.
   - **Complex Queries**: The structure supports advanced queries, such as finding the agent with the highest number of appointments or the best user feedback, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

3. **Scalability**:
   - **Ease of Expansion**: The design allows for the addition of new entities or relationships with minimal disruption, supporting future growth and feature additions.
   - **Handling Growth**: The database can efficiently handle an increasing number of users, agents, appointments, and testimonials, ensuring the app remains responsive as it scales.

4. **User and Agent Management**:
   - **Comprehensive Management**: The clear structure aids in managing user accounts, scheduling, and feedback effectively, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and agents.
   - **Role Differentiation**: The inclusion of admin roles allows for advanced management capabilities, such as overseeing user activities and maintaining system integrity.

### Normalization Explanation:

The diagram indicates a normalized database in the third normal form (3NF). This level of normalization ensures that:

- Elimination of redundancy.
- Reduction of update anomalies.
- Improvement in data integrity.

By designing the database with these relationships, a robust, scalable, and efficient system is created that can handle the core functionalities of the app while providing a great user experience.

### R7. Explain the implemented models and their relationships, including how the relationships aid the database implementation.

In my project, I've implemented several models using SQLAlchemy to represent different entities and their relationships in the database. 

### Implemented Models and Their Relationships

#### 1. User Model

The `User` model represents users of the application. It stores essential user information such as name, email, contact number, hashed password, and whether the user is an admin.

```python
from init import db, bcrypt

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    contact_number = db.Column(db.String(20))
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

    testimonials = db.relationship('Testimonial', back_populates='user', cascade='all, delete-orphan')
    appointments = db.relationship('Appointment', back_populates='user', cascade='all, delete-orphan')
```

- **Relationships**: 
  - `testimonials`: One-to-Many relationship with `Testimonial` model. One user can have multiple testimonials.
  - `appointments`: One-to-Many relationship with `Appointment` model. One user can have multiple appointments.
  
#### 2. Agent Model

The `Agent` model represents agents in the system. It includes details such as name, email, contact number, overview, and languages spoken.

```python
class Agent(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'agents'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    contact_number = db.Column(db.String(20))
    overview = db.Column(db.Text())
    languages = db.Column(db.ARRAY(db.String(50)))

    testimonials = db.relationship('Testimonial', back_populates='agent', cascade='all, delete-orphan')
    appointments = db.relationship('Appointment', back_populates='agent', cascade='all, delete-orphan')
```

- **Relationships**: 
  - `testimonials`: One-to-Many relationship with `Testimonial` model. One agent can have multiple testimonials.
  - `appointments`: One-to-Many relationship with `Appointment` model. One agent can have multiple appointments.

#### 3. Testimonial Model

The `Testimonial` model stores feedback and ratings given by users for agents. It includes fields like property address, comment, rating, and date created.

```python
class Testimonial(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'testimonials'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    property_address = db.Column(db.String(250), nullable=False)
    comment = db.Column(db.Text(), nullable=False)
    rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
    date_created = db.Column(db.Date())

    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id', onupdate="cascade", ondelete='cascade'), nullable=False)
    agent_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('agents.id', onupdate="cascade", ondelete='cascade'), nullable=False)

    user = db.relationship('User', back_populates='testimonials')
    agent = db.relationship('Agent', back_populates='testimonials')
```

- **Relationships**: 
  - `user`: Many-to-One relationship with `User` model. Many testimonials can belong to one user.
  - `agent`: Many-to-One relationship with `Agent` model. Many testimonials can belong to one agent.

#### 4. Appointment Model

The `Appointment` model represents scheduled appointments between users and agents. It includes fields for date, time, user ID, and agent ID.

```python
class Appointment(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'appointments'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    date = db.Column(db.Date(), nullable=False)
    time = db.Column(db.Time(), nullable=False)

    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id', onupdate="cascade", ondelete='cascade'), nullable=False)
    agent_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('agents.id', onupdate="cascade", ondelete='cascade'), nullable=False)

    user = db.relationship('User', back_populates='appointments')
    agent = db.relationship('Agent', back_populates='appointments')
```

- **Relationships**: 
  - `user`: Many-to-One relationship with `User` model. Many appointments can belong to one user.
  - `agent`: Many-to-One relationship with `Agent` model. Many appointments can belong to one agent.

### How Relationships Aid the Database Implementation

- **Data Integrity**: Relationships enforce referential integrity, ensuring that every testimonial, appointment, or association is linked to valid users and agents. This prevents orphan records and maintains data consistency.
  
- **Efficient Queries**: By defining relationships, SQLAlchemy allows for efficient querying and navigation across related entities. For example, fetching all testimonials for a specific agent or all appointments for a user becomes straightforward and optimized.

- **Cascade Operations**: Cascade options (`cascade='all, delete-orphan'`) automate operations such as deleting testimonials or appointments when their associated user or agent is deleted. This simplifies database maintenance and ensures data coherence without manual intervention.

In conclusion, the models and their defined relationships in this project using SQLAlchemy ORM contribute to a structured database schema, optimised querying capabilities, and automated data management operations, thereby enhancing application scalability and maintainability.
